# VPN

This project is using an aws client vpn to enable connection within the environment. A requirement beyond what is provided in the code here is the need to set up a private rsa key for upload and use with ACM. Please follow this [link for a step-by-step tutorial for doing so](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#mutual)
