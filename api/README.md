# Mircoservices

Microservices is a directory housing my web service (and possibly streaming) services which can gracefully handle continous or real-time data in a Machine Learning deployment scenario. I am approaching this problem with 3 possible means:

1. Web Services built with FastAPI & Deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service. My Bread and Butter.
2. AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and AWS S3 for a serverless ML Web Service.
3. AWS SageMaker and all that fancy, but expensive, stuff.

### Under Construction...
This is to be the final piece of the project, so hold tight, and look for more progress come ~ November 2021
