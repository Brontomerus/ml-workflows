# ml-werkflows
A project to provide an easy way to get started building distributed environments for machine learning workflows in AWS using Prefect and Dask.


# About

Using a pythonic approach, I want to build a bootstrap resource for enabling anyone to quickly get started using Dask and Prefect for distributed data processing and operatiing ML resources in cloud environments.

The idea is to use Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) to define and manage a serverless infrastructure in AWS, which can then be utilized with Prefect and Dask. I am using Poetry for package management within the workflows folder to enable a smoother process to get started.
